# Darkness Unleashed WIP-Testing-Build
With this build you can test new features! (for now less features tho duh)
- Faster Code (due to complete almost full rewrite)
- Fixes Bugs from 1.0.0
- Skyboxes!
- No Morning/Evening Preset until live-build


The true dark night mod and more!
*Inspired by Reirei*
*by Lesley & IllustrisJack*


Some maps still crash because of the skybox load.
Tested maps that SHOULD work:
- Sharqi
- Bazaar
- Seine
- Gulf (Ugly Water tho)
- Alborz
- Metro
- Shield
- Nebandan
- Ziba
- Karkand (Ugly Water tho)


**Needs PREMIUM or Armored Kill DLC to work.**
